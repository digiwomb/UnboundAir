/**
 * The `scan` command (BE-02): scans one page and writes the processed page
 * (crop plus grayscale according to [PageSettings.colorMode], SV-03) to a
 * file.
 *
 * The page is scanned through the [ScannerClient] and the raw JPEG is then
 * run through the processing chain: a [CropStep] and a [GrayscaleStep]
 * driven by [PageSettings]. Like [CropCommand], the chain runs in a
 * temporary working directory and its final result is moved to the target
 * path; the working directory is deleted afterwards.
 *
 * Processing warnings (for example: no paper found, page carried through
 * uncropped) are reported through [warn] instead of being printed by the
 * command itself, so the caller decides where they go (SV-02). Warnings of
 * the scan flow itself (for example: the 300 dpi fallback) travel through
 * the [client] and its own warn sink.
 *
 * With [PageSettings.keepRaw] set, the raw JPEG is additionally written to
 * a file derived from the target name: the same name with `_raw` inserted
 * before the extension (SV-06, [rawFileName]).
 *
 * @property client the scanner client to scan the page through.
 * @property settings the page settings of the processing chain; defaults to
 *   a [PageSettings] with all defaults (grayscale, no raw kept).
 * @property warn sink for processing warnings, e.g. a page carried through
 *   uncropped (SV-02); defaults to a no-op.
