/**
 * One step of the page processing chain (SV-07).
 *
 * A step transforms a single scanned page: it receives the page in its
 * current state as a [PageImage] (JPEG file plus the [JpegInfo] of that file)
 * and a working directory [apply.workDir] in which it may write a
 * replacement file if it changes anything.
 *
 * The contract is deliberately simple and keeps the chain safe to extend:
 *
 * - A step that changes nothing returns the *same* [PageImage] instance it
 *   received, so passing through costs no file I/O.
 * - A step that changes the page writes the result into the working
 *   directory and returns a new [PageImage] with a freshly read [JpegInfo].
 *
 * A step that hits a degenerate case (for example: no paper found, page
 * carried through uncropped) reports it through [apply.warn] instead of
 * failing; a page always reaches the end of the chain.
 *
 * The chain is cut this way so that later steps (rotation, deskew, and
 * eventually the PDF building) are added by appending them to the step list,
 * without touching the existing steps (SV-07).
 *
 * @property name the name of this step, used in logs and warnings.
